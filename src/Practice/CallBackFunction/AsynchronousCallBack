Asynchronous operations are operations that run in parallel to one another. 
Unlike synchronous operations illustrated in the previous section, asynchronous tasks are non-blocking.
 They don’t wait for one another before performing their operations.
  Let’s update the EventListener interface to illustrate an asynchronous callback function in Java:
  
  
  public class AsynchronousEventConsumer{

    private EventListener listener;

    public AsynchronousEventConsumer(EventListener listener) {
        this.listener = listener;
    }

    public void doAsynchronousOperation(){
        System.out.println("Performing operation in Asynchronous Task");

        new Thread(() -> listener.onTrigger()).start();
    }
}

The AsynchronousEventConsumer class above declares a doAsynchronousOperation() method that 
implicitly invokes the onTrigger() method of the EventListener in a new thread.
Note that this approach of creating a new Thread for each method call is an anti-pattern and is used here for demonstration purposes. 
Production-ready code should rely on properly sized and tuned thread pools.

EventListener listener = Mockito.mock(AsynchronousEventListenerImpl.class);
AsynchronousEventConsumer synchronousEventListenerConsumer = new AsynchronousEventConsumer(listener);
synchronousEventListenerConsumer.doAsynchronousOperation();

verify(listener, timeout(1000).times(1)).onTrigger();
