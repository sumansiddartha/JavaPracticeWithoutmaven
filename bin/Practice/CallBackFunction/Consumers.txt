Consumers are functional interfaces that are commonly used in functional programming in Java.
 Implementations of the interface accept an argument and perform an operation with the provided argument but don’t return a result.
 
 Using Consumers, we can pass a method as an argument to another method.
  This allows us to invoke and run the operations of the inner method from within the parent method.
  
  
  Let’s consider a method that increases the value of a given number represented as age. 
  We can pass the initial age as the first argument and a Consumer that will serve as the second method to increment the age.
  
  Here’s an illustration of how we can implement this as a callback function using Consumers:

public class ConsumerCallback {
    public void getAge(int initialAge, Consumer<Integer> callback) {
        callback.accept(initialAge);
    }

    public void increaseAge(int initialAge, int ageDifference, Consumer<Integer> callback) {
        System.out.println("===== Increase age ====");

        int newAge = initialAge + ageDifference;
        callback.accept(newAge);
    }
}

In the above snippet, we pass a function to the getAge() method. This function invokes the increaseAge() method and asserts that the value of the newAge variable equals the sum of the initialAge and ageDifference.

The callback functions in this context are the functions passed to the getAge() and increaseAge() methods. These functions are triggered to perform any custom operation after each of the getAge() and increaseAge() methods have completed their tasks.
