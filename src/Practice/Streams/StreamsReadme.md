                                                       Java Streams
                                                       
   A stream in Java is simply a wrapper around a data source, allowing us to perform bulk operations on the data in a convenient way.
   It doesn’t store data or make any changes to the underlying data source. Rather, it adds support for functional-style operations on data pipelines.
   
   By default, any stream operation in Java is processed sequentially, unless explicitly specified as parallel.
