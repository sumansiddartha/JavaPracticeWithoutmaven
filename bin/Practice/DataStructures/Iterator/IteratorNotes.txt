-->An iterator is a software design pattern that abstracts the process of scanning 
through a collection of elements one element at a time.

---->an iterator extends the concept of the position ADT
---->An iterator encapsulates the concepts of "place" and "next" 
	in a collection of objects
	--->hasNext(): Test whether there are elements left in the iterator.
		next(): Return the next element in the iterator.
		
------>In order to provide a unified generic mechanism for 
	scanning through a data structure, 
	ADTs storing collections of objects should support the following method:
	
	iterator(): Return an iterator of the elements in the collection.
